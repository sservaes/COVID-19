# Impact of COVID-19 on mortality in Belgium
 
This project consists out of a scraper and an anlysis on the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in Belgium.
In total, over 15.000 pages were scraped from a website (inmemoriam.be) that tracks mortalities in Belgium for a total of +170,000 data entry points between 2009 and 2020. This data was subsequently cleaned and provided as a tidy format allowing analysis and visualization giving an idea of the excess mortality that was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
